Need to enable the CDN for font awesome to work
http://fontawesome.io/

<script src="https://use.fontawesome.com/f158bdf0af.js"></script>



I got some errors when installing 


npm install react-sortable-table


I had to do a 


npm cache verify


to get it to work... see this url for more fixes - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22325031/npm-please-try-using-this-command-again-as-root-administrator





that table is all fucked... 2 years old, needs to be updated...


check the fork that was updated on August 29th... probably works but the guy looks to be programming in an unorthodox/old way
